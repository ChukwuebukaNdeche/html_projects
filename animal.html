            The tiger's adaptations of having noctural habits, striped camouflage, execellent vision,
            and hearing, sharp teeth and claws, a flexible spine and the ability to quietly and quickly
             pounce on a predator are the tiger's biggest advantage to remaining alive on our planet.

            licking certain objects or food until a frothy saliva forms, then rubbing the saliva
             onto thier skin and spines, which is believed to make a smell less palatable to predators.

            Their huntig skills are aided by stealthy senses of smell, hearing and night vision. Red foxes can hear
            the low frequency sound of small animals digging under the ground, leaves, or snow. They use the earth's magnetic
            field to help zero on their prey before pouncing.

            Cormorants are expert divers. Some dive as deep as 45 meters(150 feet). They speed along 
            underwater via their webbed feet, using their wings as rudders. Some colonies of Cormorants
            have been observed herding fish for more efficient hunting.
